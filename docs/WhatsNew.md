# What's New in Sitrec

<!--
## AI Instructions for Updating This Document

IMPORTANT: Always check what the last documented version is, and update ALL missing versions up to the current version.

CRITICAL - DO NOT HALLUCINATE:
- ONLY document features that are explicitly mentioned in git commit messages
- NEVER invent, guess, or assume features that might exist
- If a commit message is unclear, examine the actual code changes
- If you cannot verify a feature from commits, DO NOT include it
- It is better to have a sparse changelog than an inaccurate one

When updating this changelog:

1. **Check last documented version**: Look at the first version heading below these instructions
2. **Get version tags**: Run `git tag -l "2.*" --sort=-version:refname --format='%(refname:short)|%(creatordate:short)' | head -20`
3. **Get commits between versions**: Run `git log [old_tag]..[new_tag] --pretty=format:"%s"` for each missing version
   - To find the previous tag, list all tags and find the one before: `git tag -l "2.*" --sort=-version:refname`
4. **Get commits since last tag**: Run `git log [latest_tag]..HEAD --pretty=format:"%s"` for unreleased changes
5. **Verify each entry**: Every changelog entry MUST correspond to an actual commit message
6. **Categorize entries**:
   - **New Features**: New functionality, UI additions, new file format support
   - **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing features, performance, UX improvements
   - **Bug Fixes**: Entries starting with "Fixed", "Fix", corrections to existing behavior
7. **Write clean descriptions**: Convert commit messages to user-friendly descriptions. Look at actual code changes if the commit message is unclear.
8. **Format**: Use present tense, focus on user benefit, be concise
9. **Add new versions at the top** of the document, below these instructions
10. **Include the date** with each version heading
11. **Omit empty sections**: If a version has no New Features, don't include that heading

Example entry format:
## Version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)
