# Saving and Loading Sitches

This guide explains all save/load workflows in Sitrec:

- **Server/S3 save**: versioned saves you can reopen/share.
- **Local folder save**: fast local workflow without a file server.

Use whichever matches your workflow. You can also move between them.

## Saving to the Server (Versioned)

Server save is best when you want version history and easy sharing.

### What the Server menu does

In **File -> Server (...)**, you will see:

- **Save**: save a new version of the current sitch.
- **Save As**: save under a new sitch name.
- **Open**: open the sitch browser to load your saved sitches (and featured sitches).
- **Versions**: load any saved version of the currently loaded sitch.

If you are not logged in, server saving is disabled until login.

### How versions work

- Each **Save** creates a timestamped version in that sitch's server folder.
- **Save** does not delete old versions.
- The **Versions** dropdown shows timestamps; newest is marked **(latest)**.
- Loading a sitch from **Open** loads its latest version by default.
- If content is unchanged, Sitrec can skip creating a duplicate new version.

### Save vs Save As

- **Save** keeps the current sitch name and appends a new version.
- **Save As** prompts for a new sitch name, creating a separate sitch history.

### Asset handling on server save

When needed, Sitrec rehosts dynamic/imported assets before saving so the sitch references stable server objects instead of temporary local drops.

## Saving to a Local Folder

Local save is best when you want fast offline-like iteration and no server dependency.

### Browser support

Local folder access uses the browser File System Access API.

- Supported: Chrome and Edge (Chromium-based browsers).
- Not supported: Firefox (and some other browsers).

If unsupported, Sitrec shows a message asking you to use Chrome or Edge.

### First-time setup

1. Open **File -> Local -> Select Local Sitch Folder**.
2. Pick a working folder (prefer a dedicated project subfolder).
3. Use **Open Local Sitch**, **Save Local**, or **Save Local As...**.

`Save Local`, `Save Local As...`, and `Open Local Sitch` appear after a working folder is selected.

### Local menu actions

- **Select Local Sitch Folder**: select/change your working folder. Does not auto-load a sitch.
- **Open Local Sitch**: pick a `.json`/`.js` sitch from the working folder.
- **Save Local**: save to current local target.
- **Save Local As...**: save with a new filename in the working folder.
- **Reconnect Folder**: re-grant permission if the browser has remembered the folder but access is no longer granted.

### Important `Save Local` behavior

- After **New Sitch** or after loading from server/S3, `Save Local` behaves like `Save Local As...` first.
- This prevents accidentally overwriting your last local sitch file.

### What gets copied into the local folder

For portable local sitches, Sitrec copies **dynamic/imported** assets that have in-memory source data (for example dropped files).

Path behavior is:

- If an asset already points to a valid relative path in the working folder, Sitrec keeps/reuses that path.
- Otherwise, Sitrec chooses a default path under `local/...`, typically:
  - `local/media`
  - `local/tracks`
  - `local/models`
  - `local/assets`

So those `local/...` folders are defaults for newly copied assets, not a guaranteed location for every local reference.

If the exact same file content already exists at the chosen path, Sitrec reuses it.
If a same-name file exists with different bytes, Sitrec keeps both (adds suffixes like `-2`, `-3`).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

`Cmd/Ctrl+S` repeats the last successful save intent when possible:

- last action local -> local save
- last action local-as -> local save as
- last action server -> server save

If there is no prior save action, server save is used when available; otherwise local save is used.

`Cmd/Ctrl+O` opens the server sitch browser.

## Choosing Between Server and Local

- Use **Server/S3** when you want version history, sharing, and cloud-backed access.
- Use **Local folder** when you want maximum load/save speed and no backend dependency.
- You can switch workflows anytime:
  - server -> local: load from server, then `Save Local`/`Save Local As...`
  - local -> server: open local sitch, then server `Save`/`Save As`

## Status and Error Feedback (Local)

The Local menu has a persistent **Status** row showing:

- local state (Ready / Needs reconnect / No folder)
- current folder name
- current save target file (if armed)

If local save fails, Sitrec shows a user-visible error dialog with error type/code/message and recovery guidance.
For example, `NotFoundError` usually means the selected folder/file was moved, deleted, or is no longer accessible.

## Caveats

- Server save/load options may be hidden in builds where server saving is disabled.
- Server save generally requires login for your own saved sitches.
- Local folder permissions are browser-controlled and can be revoked between sessions.
- Avoid system/protected folders (for example certain top-level macOS folders); use a normal project subfolder.
- Local and server workflows are separate; local saves are not auto-synced to server.

## Troubleshooting

### "Local folder access is not supported"

Use Chrome or Edge.

### Local save fails with `NotFoundError`

Selected folder/file is no longer available. Re-select **Select Local Sitch Folder**, then save again.

### `Open Local Sitch` is missing

Select a working folder first with **Select Local Sitch Folder**.

### Dragged media worked before save, but fails after reload

Re-save after selecting a valid local folder (for local workflow), or save to server again so media/object references are persisted correctly.
